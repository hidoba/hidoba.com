# (very messy) sources for ultrasound directional speaker

> [YOUTUBE: A pocket-sized directional speaker](https://youtu.be/tj980NAlydM) done by my student Vlad Orlov

I've never intended to put the sources online, but since many people asked, here we go.

The circuit was "post-adjusted" for 75V, I'm not sure about any other modifications. Pay attention at the inductor in series with ultrasound speakers (value may need to be adjusted). When connecting speakers, mind polarity.

The working device looked like that:

The version before modifications (excuse my student for messy soldering --- it was his first time):

The original (un-modified) scheme curcuit:
